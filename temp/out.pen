Data information knowledge and wisdom,
are closely related concepts but,
each has its own role in relation,
to the other and each term has its own,
meaning According to a common,
view data are collected and,
analyzed; data only becomes information suitable for making decisions,
once it has been analyzed,
in some fashion One can,
say that the extent to,
which a set of data is informative to someone,
depends on the extent to,
which it is unexpected by,
that person The amount of,
information contained in a data,
stream may be characterized by its Shannon entropy Knowledge,
is the understanding based on,
extensive experience dealing with information,
on a subject For example,
the height of Mount Everest,
is generally considered data The,
height can be measured precisely with an altimeter and,
entered into a database This,
data may be included in,
a book along with other,
data on Mount Everest to,
describe the mountain in a,
manner useful for those who,
wish to make a decision about the best method,
to climb it An understanding,
based on experience climbing mountains,
that could advise persons on,
the way to reach Mount,
Everest's peak may be seen,
as "knowledge" The practical climbing,
of Mount Everest's peak based,
on this knowledge may be seen as "wisdom" In,
other words wisdom refers to,
the practical application of a,
person's knowledge in those circumstances,
where good may result Thus,
wisdom complements and completes the,
series "data" "information" and "knowledge",
of increasingly abstract concepts Data,
are often assumed to be,
the least abstract concept information the next least and,
knowledge the most abstract In,
this view data becomes information,
by interpretation; eg the height,
of Mount Everest is generally,
considered "data" a book on,
Mount Everest geological characteristics may,
be considered "information" and a,
climber's guidebook containing practical information,
on the best way to,
reach Mount Everest's peak may be considered "knowledge" "Information",
bears a diversity of meanings,
that ranges from everyday usage,
to technical use This view,
however has also been argued,
to reverse the way in,
which data emerges from information,
and information from knowledge Generally,
speaking the concept of information,
is closely related to notions,
of constraint communication control data,
form instruction knowledge meaning mental stimulus pattern perception and,
representation Beynon-Davies uses the concept,
of a sign to differentiate,
between data and information; data,
are a series of symbols,
while information occurs when the,
symbols are used to refer,
to something Before the development,
of computing devices and machines,
people had to manually collect,
data and impose patterns on,
it Since the development of,
computing devices and machines these devices can also collect,
data In the 2010s computers,
are widely used in many,
fields to collect data and,
sort or process it in,
disciplines ranging from marketing analysis,
of social services usage by,
citizens to scientific research These,
patterns in data are seen,
as information which can be,
used to enhance knowledge These,
patterns may be interpreted as,
"truth" (though "truth" can be,
a subjective concept) and may be authorized as aesthetic,
and ethical criteria in some,
disciplines or cultures Events that,
leave behind perceivable physical or,
virtual remains can be traced,
back through data Marks are,
no longer considered data once,
the link between the mark,
and observation is broken Mechanical,
computing devices are classified according,
to the means by which,
they represent data An analog,
computer represents a datum as,
a voltage distance position or,
other physical quantity A digital computer represents a piece,
of data as a sequence,
of symbols drawn from a,
fixed alphabet The most common,
digital computers use a binary,
alphabet that is an alphabet,
of two characters typically denoted,
"0" and "1" More familiar,
representations such as numbers or,
letters are then constructed from,
the binary alphabet Some special,
forms of data are distinguished,
A computer program is a,
collection of data which can,
be interpreted as instructions Most,
computer languages make a distinction between programs and the,
other data on which programs,
operate but in some languages,
notably Lisp and similar languages,
programs are essentially indistinguishable from,
other data It is also,
useful to distinguish metadata that,
is a description of other,
data A similar yet earlier,
term for metadata is "ancillary,
data" The prototypical example of,
metadata is the library catalog,
which is a description of,
the contents of books In,
the early 1940s memory technology,
often permitted a capacity of,
a few bytes The first electronic programmable digital computer,
the ENIAC using thousands of,
octal-base radio vacuum tubes could,
perform simple calculations involving 20,
numbers of ten decimal digits,
which were held in the,
vacuum tube The next significant,
advance in computer memory came,
with acoustic delay line memory,
developed by J Presper Eckert,
in the early 1940s Through,
the construction of a glass,
tube filled with mercury and,
plugged at each end with,
a quartz crystal delay lines,
could store bits of information,
in the form of sound,
waves propagating through mercury with the quartz crystals acting,
as transducers to read and,
write bits Delay line memory,
was limited to a capacity,
of up to a few,
hundred thousand bits to remain,
efficient Two alternatives to the,
delay line the Williams tube,
and Selectron tube originated in,
1946 both using electron beams,
in glass tubes as means,
of storage Using cathode ray,
tubes Fred Williams invented the,
Williams tube which was the,
first random-access computer memory The,
Williams tube was more capacious,
than the Selectron tube (the,
Selectron was limited to 256,
bits while the Williams tube could store thousands) and,
less expensive The Williams tube,
was nevertheless frustratingly sensitive to,
environmental disturbances Efforts began in,
the late 1940s to find,
non-volatile memory Magnetic-core memory allowed,
for recall of memory after,
power loss It was developed,
by Frederick W Viehe and,
An Wang in the late,
1940s and improved by Jay,
Forrester and Jan A Rajchman,
in the early 1950s before,
being commercialised with the Whirlwind,
computer in 1953 Magnetic-core memory,
was the dominant form of,
memory until the development of,
MOS semiconductor memory in the,
1960s Semiconductor memory began in,
the early 1960s with bipolar memory which used bipolar,
transistors Bipolar semiconductor memory made,
from discrete devices was first,
shipped by Texas Instruments to,
the United States Air Force,
in 1961 The same year,
the concept of solid-state memory,
on an integrated circuit (IC),
chip was proposed by applications,
engineer Bob Norman at Fairchild,
Semiconductor The first bipolar semiconductor,
memory IC chip was the,
SP95 introduced by IBM in,
1965 While bipolar memory offered,
improved performance over magnetic-core memory,
it could not compete with,
the lower price of magnetic-core,
which remained dominant up until,
the late 1960s Bipolar memory,
failed to replace magnetic-core memory,
because bipolar flip-flop circuits were too large and expensive,
MOS memory Main article: MOS,
memory The invention of the,
MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor or,
MOS transistor) by Mohamed M,
Atalla and Dawon Kahng at,
Bell Labs in 1959 enabled,
the practical use of metal–oxide–semiconductor,
(MOS) transistors as memory cell,
storage elements MOS memory was,
developed by John Schmidt at,
Fairchild Semiconductor in 1964 In,
addition to higher performance MOS,
semiconductor memory was cheaper and,
consumed less power than magnetic,
core memory In 1965 J,
Wood and R Ball of,
the Royal Radar Establishment proposed,
digital storage systems that use,
CMOS (complementary MOS) memory cells,
in addition to MOSFET power,
devices for the power supply switched cross-coupling switches and,
delay line storage The development,
of silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit,
(MOS IC) technology by Federico,
Faggin at Fairchild in 1968,
enabled the production of MOS,
memory chips NMOS memory was,
commercialized by IBM in the,
early 1970s MOS memory overtook,
magnetic core memory as the,
dominant memory technology in the,
early 1970s The two main,
types of volatile random-access memory,
(RAM) are static random-access memory,
(SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory,
(DRAM) Bipolar SRAM was invented,
by Robert Norman at Fairchild,
Semiconductor in 1963 followed by,
the development of MOS SRAM,
by John Schmidt at Fairchild,
in 1964 SRAM became an,
alternative to magnetic-core memory but,
required six MOS transistors for each bit of data,
Commercial use of SRAM began,
in 1965 when IBM introduced,
their SP95 SRAM chip for,
the System/360 Model 95 Toshiba,
introduced bipolar DRAM memory cells,
for its Toscal BC-1411 electronic,
calculator in 1965 While it,
offered improved performance over magnetic-core,
memory bipolar DRAM could not,
compete with the lower price,
of the then dominant magnetic-core,
memory MOS technology is the,
basis for modern DRAM In,
1966 Dr Robert H Dennard,
at the IBM Thomas J,
Watson Research Center was working,
on MOS memory While examining,
the characteristics of MOS technology,
he found it was capable,
of building capacitors and that,
storing a charge or no,
charge on the MOS capacitor,
could represent the 1 and 0 of a bit,
while the MOS transistor could,
control writing the charge to,
the capacitor This led to,
his development of a single-transistor,
DRAM memory cell In 1967,
Dennard filed a patent under,
IBM for a single-transistor DRAM,
memory cell based on MOS,
technology This led to the,
first commercial DRAM IC chip,
the Intel 1103 in October,
1970 Synchronous dynamic random-access memory,
(SDRAM) later debuted with the,
Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in 1992,
The term "memory" is also,
often used to refer to,
non-volatile memory specifically flash memory,
It has origins in read-only,
memory (ROM) Programmable read-only memory,
(PROM) was invented by Wen,
Tsing Chow in 1956 while,
working for the Arma Division,
of the American Bosch Arma,

J Watson Research Center was,
working on MOS memory While,
examining the characteristics of MOS,
technology he found it was,
capable of building capacitors and,
that storing a charge or,
no charge on the MOS,
capacitor could represent the 1,
and 0 of a bit,
while the MOS transistor could,
control writing the charge to,
the capacitor This led to,
his development of a single-transistor,
DRAM memory cell In 1967 Dennard filed a patent,
under IBM for a single-transistor,
DRAM memory cell based on,
MOS technology This led to,
the first commercial DRAM IC,
chip the Intel 1103 in,
October 1970 Synchronous dynamic random-access,
memory (SDRAM) later debuted with,
the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in,
1992 The term "memory" is,
also often used to refer,
to non-volatile memory specifically flash,
memory It has origins in,
read-only memory (ROM) Programmable read-only,
memory (PROM) was invented by,
Wen Tsing Chow in 1956,
while working for the Arma,
Division of the American Bosch,
Arma Corporation Data information knowledge,
and wisdom are closely related,
concepts but each has its,
own role in relation to,
the other and each term,
has its own meaning According,
to a common view data,
are collected and analyzed; data,
only becomes information suitable for,
making decisions once it has,
been analyzed in some fashion,
One can say that the,
extent to which a set,
of data is informative to,
someone depends on the extent,
to which it is unexpected,
by that person The amount,
of information contained in a,
data stream may be characterized,
by its Shannon entropy Knowledge,
is the understanding based on,
extensive experience dealing with information,
on a subject For example,
the height of Mount Everest,
is generally considered data The,
height can be measured precisely with an altimeter and,
entered into a database This,
data may be included in,
a book along with other,
data on Mount Everest to,
describe the mountain in a,
manner useful for those who,
wish to make a decision,
about the best method to,
climb it An understanding based,
on experience climbing mountains that,
could advise persons on the,
way to reach Mount Everest's,
peak may be seen as,
"knowledge" The practical climbing of,
Mount Everest's peak based on,
this knowledge may be seen,
as "wisdom" In other words,
wisdom refers to the practical,
application of a person's knowledge,
in those circumstances where good,
may result Thus wisdom complements,
and completes the series "data",
"information" and "knowledge" of increasingly,
abstract concepts Data are often,
assumed to be the least,
abstract concept information the next,
least and knowledge the most,
abstract In this view data,
becomes information by interpretation; eg,
the height of Mount Everest,
is generally considered "data" a,
book on Mount Everest geological,
characteristics may be considered "information",
and a climber's guidebook containing,
practical information on the best,
way to reach Mount Everest's,
peak may be considered "knowledge",
"Information" bears a diversity of,
meanings that ranges from everyday,
usage to technical use This,
view however has also been,
argued to reverse the way,
in which data emerges from,
information and information from knowledge Generally speaking the concept,
of information is closely related,
to notions of constraint communication,
control data form instruction knowledge,
meaning mental stimulus pattern perception,
and representation Beynon-Davies uses the,
concept of a sign to,
differentiate between data and information;,
data are a series of,
symbols while information occurs when,
the symbols are used to,
refer to something Before the,
development of computing devices and,
machines people had to manually,
collect data and impose patterns,
on it Since the development,
of computing devices and machines,
these devices can also collect,
data In the 2010s computers,
are widely used in many,
fields to collect data and,
sort or process it in,
disciplines ranging from marketing analysis,
of social services usage by,
citizens to scientific research These,
patterns in data are seen,
as information which can be,
used to enhance knowledge These,
patterns may be interpreted as,
"truth" (though "truth" can be,
a subjective concept) and may,
be authorized as aesthetic and,
ethical criteria in some disciplines,
or cultures Events that leave,
behind perceivable physical or virtual,
remains can be traced back,
through data Marks are no,
longer considered data once the,
link between the mark and,
observation is broken Mechanical computing,
devices are classified according to,
the means by which they,
represent data An analog computer,
represents a datum as a,
voltage distance position or other,
physical quantity A digital computer represents a piece of,
data as a sequence of,
symbols drawn from a fixed,
alphabet The most common digital,
computers use a binary alphabet,
that is an alphabet of,
two characters typically denoted "0",
and "1" More familiar representations,
such as numbers or letters,
are then constructed from the,
binary alphabet Some special forms,
of data are distinguished A,
computer program is a collection,
of data which can be,
interpreted as instructions Most computer,
languages make a distinction between,
programs and the other data,
on which programs operate but,
in some languages notably Lisp,
and similar languages programs are,
essentially indistinguishable from other data,
It is also useful to,
distinguish metadata that is a,
description of other data A,
similar yet earlier term for,
metadata is "ancillary data" The,
prototypical example of metadata is,
the library catalog which is,
a description of the contents,
of books In the early,
1940s memory technology often permitted,
a capacity of a few,
bytes The first electronic programmable,
digital computer the ENIAC using,
thousands of octal-base radio vacuum,
tubes could perform simple calculations,
involving 20 numbers of ten,
decimal digits which were held,
in the vacuum tube The,
next significant advance in computer,
memory came with acoustic delay,
line memory developed by J,
Presper Eckert in the early,
1940s Through the construction of,
a glass tube filled with,
mercury and plugged at each,
end with a quartz crystal delay lines could store,
bits of information in the,
form of sound waves propagating,
through mercury with the quartz,
crystals acting as transducers to,
read and write bits Delay,
line memory was limited to,
a capacity of up to,
a few hundred thousand bits,
to remain efficient Two alternatives,
to the delay line the,
Williams tube and Selectron tube,
originated in 1946 both using,
electron beams in glass tubes,
as means of storage Using,
cathode ray tubes Fred Williams,
invented the Williams tube which,
was the first random-access computer,
memory The Williams tube was,
more capacious than the Selectron,
tube (the Selectron was limited,
to 256 bits while the,
Williams tube could store thousands),
and less expensive The Williams,
tube was nevertheless frustratingly sensitive,
to environmental disturbances Efforts began,
in the late 1940s to,
find non-volatile memory Magnetic-core memory,
allowed for recall of memory,
after power loss It was,
developed by Frederick W Viehe,
and An Wang in the,
late 1940s and improved by,
Jay Forrester and Jan A,
Rajchman in the early 1950s,
before being commercialised with the,
Whirlwind computer in 1953 Magnetic-core,
memory was the dominant form,
of memory until the development,
of MOS semiconductor memory in,
the 1960s Semiconductor memory began,
in the early 1960s with,
bipolar memory which used bipolar,
transistors Bipolar semiconductor memory made,
from discrete devices was first,
shipped by Texas Instruments to,
the United States Air Force,
in 1961 The same year the concept of solid-state,
memory on an integrated circuit,
(IC) chip was proposed by,
applications engineer Bob Norman at,
Fairchild Semiconductor The first bipolar,
semiconductor memory IC chip was,
the SP95 introduced by IBM,
in 1965 While bipolar memory,
offered improved performance over magnetic-core,
memory it could not compete,
with the lower price of,
magnetic-core which remained dominant up,
until the late 1960s Bipolar,
memory failed to replace magnetic-core,
memory because bipolar flip-flop circuits,
were too large and expensive,
MOS memory Main article: MOS,
memory The invention of the,
MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor or,
MOS transistor) by Mohamed M,
Atalla and Dawon Kahng at,
Bell Labs in 1959 enabled,
the practical use of metal–oxide–semiconductor,
(MOS) transistors as memory cell,
storage elements MOS memory was,
developed by John Schmidt at,
Fairchild Semiconductor in 1964 In,
addition to higher performance MOS,
semiconductor memory was cheaper and,
consumed less power than magnetic,
core memory In 1965 J,
Wood and R Ball of,
the Royal Radar Establishment proposed,
digital storage systems that use,
CMOS (complementary MOS) memory cells,
in addition to MOSFET power,
devices for the power supply,
switched cross-coupling switches and delay,
line storage The development of,
silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit (MOS,
IC) technology by Federico Faggin,
at Fairchild in 1968 enabled,
the production of MOS memory,
chips NMOS memory was commercialized,
by IBM in the early,
1970s MOS memory overtook magnetic,
core memory as the dominant,
memory technology in the early,
1970s The two main types of volatile random-access memory,
(RAM) are static random-access memory,
(SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory,
(DRAM) Bipolar SRAM was invented,
by Robert Norman at Fairchild,
Semiconductor in 1963 followed by,
the development of MOS SRAM,
by John Schmidt at Fairchild,
in 1964 SRAM became an,
alternative to magnetic-core memory but,
required six MOS transistors for,
each bit of data Commercial,
use of SRAM began in,
1965 when IBM introduced their,
SP95 SRAM chip for the,
System/360 Model 95 Toshiba introduced,
bipolar DRAM memory cells for,
its Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator,
in 1965 While it offered,
improved performance over magnetic-core memory,
bipolar DRAM could not compete,
with the lower price of,
the then dominant magnetic-core memory,
MOS technology is the basis,
for modern DRAM In 1966,

amount of information contained in,
a data stream may be characterized by its Shannon entropy Knowledge is,
the understanding based on extensive experience dealing with information on,
a subject For example the height of Mount Everest is generally considered,
data The height can be measured precisely with an,
altimeter and entered into a database This data may,
be included in a book along with other data,
on Mount Everest to describe the mountain in a,
manner useful for those who wish to make a,
decision about the best method to climb it An,
understanding based on experience climbing mountains that could advise,
persons on the way to reach Mount Everest's peak,
may be seen as "knowledge" The practical climbing of Mount Everest's peak,
based on this knowledge may be seen as "wisdom",
In other words wisdom refers to the practical application,
of a person's knowledge in those circumstances where good,
may result Thus wisdom complements and completes the series,
"data" "information" and "knowledge" of increasingly abstract concepts Data,
are often assumed to be the,
least abstract concept information the next,
least and knowledge the most abstract,
In this view data becomes information by interpretation; eg the height of,
Mount Everest is generally considered "data" a book on Mount,
Everest geological characteristics may be considered "information" and a climber's,
guidebook containing practical information on the best way to reach,
Mount Everest's peak may be considered "knowledge" "Information" bears a,
diversity of meanings that ranges from everyday usage to technical use This,
view however has also been argued to reverse the way,
in which data emerges from,
information and information from knowledge Generally speaking the concept of information is,
closely related to notions of constraint communication control data form,
instruction knowledge meaning mental stimulus pattern perception and representation Beynon-Davies,
uses the concept of a sign to differentiate between data and information;,
data are a series of symbols while information occurs,
when the symbols are used to refer to something,
Before the development of computing devices and machines people,
had to manually collect data and impose patterns on,
it Since the development of computing devices and machines,
these devices can also collect data In the 2010s,
computers are widely used in,
many fields to collect data,
and sort or process it,
in disciplines ranging from marketing,
analysis of social services usage,
by citizens to scientific research,
These patterns in data are,
seen as information which can be used to enhance knowledge These patterns,
may be interpreted as "truth" (though "truth" can be a,
subjective concept) and may be,
authorized as aesthetic and ethical,
criteria in some disciplines or,
cultures Events that leave behind,
perceivable physical or virtual remains can be traced back through data Marks,
are no longer considered data once the link between the,
mark and observation is broken Mechanical computing devices are classified,
according to the means by which they represent data An,
analog computer represents a datum as a voltage distance position or other,
physical quantity A digital computer represents a piece of data,
as a sequence of symbols drawn from a fixed alphabet,
The most common digital computers use a binary alphabet that,
is an alphabet of two characters typically denoted "0" and,
"1" More familiar representations such as numbers or letters are,
then constructed from the binary alphabet Some special forms of,
data are distinguished A computer program is a collection of,
data which can be interpreted as instructions Most computer languages,
make a distinction between programs and the other data on which programs,
operate but in some languages notably Lisp and similar languages,
programs are essentially indistinguishable from other data It is also,
useful to distinguish metadata that is a description of other,
data A similar yet earlier term for metadata is "ancillary,
data" The prototypical example of metadata is the library catalog,
which is a description of the contents of books In,
the early 1940s memory technology often permitted a capacity of,
a few bytes The first electronic programmable digital computer the,
ENIAC using thousands of octal-base radio vacuum tubes could perform,
simple calculations involving 20 numbers,
of ten decimal digits which were held in the vacuum tube The,
next significant advance in computer memory came with acoustic,
delay line memory developed by J Presper Eckert in,
the early 1940s Through the construction of a glass,
tube filled with mercury and plugged at each end,
with a quartz crystal delay lines could store bits,
of information in the form of sound waves propagating,
through mercury with the quartz crystals acting as transducers,
to read and write bits Delay line memory was,
limited to a capacity of up to a few,
hundred thousand bits to remain efficient Two alternatives to,
the delay line the Williams tube and Selectron tube,
originated in 1946 both using electron beams in glass tubes as means,
of storage Using cathode ray tubes Fred Williams invented,
the Williams tube which was the first random-access computer,
memory The Williams tube was more capacious than the,
Selectron tube (the Selectron was limited to 256 bits,
while the Williams tube could store thousands) and less,
expensive The Williams tube was nevertheless frustratingly sensitive to,
environmental disturbances Efforts began in the late 1940s to,
find non-volatile memory Magnetic-core memory allowed for recall of,
memory after power loss It was developed by Frederick,
W Viehe and An Wang in the late 1940s,
and improved by Jay Forrester and Jan A Rajchman,
in the early 1950s before,
being commercialised with the Whirlwind,
computer in 1953 Magnetic-core memory was the dominant form of memory until,
the development of MOS semiconductor memory,
in the 1960s Semiconductor memory began,
in the early 1960s with bipolar memory which used bipolar transistors Bipolar,
semiconductor memory made from discrete devices was first shipped by,
Texas Instruments to the United States Air Force in 1961,
The same year the concept,
of solid-state memory on an,
integrated circuit (IC) chip was proposed by applications engineer Bob Norman at,
Fairchild Semiconductor The first bipolar semiconductor memory IC chip was,
the SP95 introduced by IBM in 1965 While bipolar memory,
offered improved performance over magnetic-core memory it could not compete,
with the lower price of magnetic-core which remained dominant up,
until the late 1960s Bipolar memory failed to replace magnetic-core,
memory because bipolar flip-flop circuits were too large and expensive,
MOS memory Main article: MOS memory The invention of the,
MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor or MOS transistor) by Mohamed M,
Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959 enabled,
the practical use of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) transistors as memory cell storage elements,
MOS memory was developed by John Schmidt at Fairchild Semiconductor,
in 1964 In addition to higher performance MOS semiconductor memory,
was cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic core memory,
In 1965 J Wood and R Ball of the Royal,
Radar Establishment proposed digital storage systems that use CMOS (complementary,
MOS) memory cells in addition to MOSFET power devices for,
the power supply switched cross-coupling switches and delay line storage,
The development of silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit (MOS IC) technology,
by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in 1968 enabled the production,
of MOS memory chips NMOS memory was commercialized by IBM,
in the early 1970s MOS memory overtook magnetic core memory,
as the dominant memory technology in the early 1970s The,
two main types of volatile random-access memory (RAM) are static random-access memory,
(SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) Bipolar SRAM was,
invented by Robert Norman at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963,
followed by the development of MOS SRAM by John,
Schmidt at Fairchild in 1964 SRAM became an alternative,
to magnetic-core memory but required six MOS transistors for,
each bit of data Commercial use of SRAM began,
in 1965 when IBM introduced their SP95 SRAM chip,
for the System/360 Model 95 Toshiba introduced bipolar DRAM,
memory cells for its Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator in,
1965 While it offered improved performance over magnetic-core memory,
bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price,
of the then dominant magnetic-core memory MOS technology is,
the basis for modern DRAM In 1966 Dr Robert,
H Dennard at the IBM Thomas J Watson Research,
Center was working on MOS memory While examining the characteristics of MOS,
technology he found it was capable of building capacitors,
and that storing a charge or no charge on,
the MOS capacitor could represent the 1 and 0,
of a bit while the MOS transistor could control,
writing the charge to the capacitor This led to,
his development of a single-transistor DRAM memory cell In,
1967 Dennard filed a patent under IBM for a,
single-transistor DRAM memory cell based,
on MOS technology This led to the first commercial DRAM IC chip,
the Intel 1103 in October 1970,
Synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) later,
debuted with the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip,
in 1992 The term "memory" is,
also often used to refer to,
non-volatile memory specifically flash memory It has origins in read-only memory (ROM),
Programmable read-only memory (PROM) was invented by Wen Tsing,
Chow in 1956 while working for,
the Arma Division of the American,
Bosch Arma Corporation Data information knowledge and wisdom are closely related concepts,
but each has its own role in relation to the,
other and each term has its own meaning According to,
a common view data are collected and analyzed; data only,
becomes information suitable for making decisions once it has been,
analyzed in some fashion One can say that the extent,
to which a set of data is informative to someone,
depends on the extent to which it is unexpected by that person,
The amount of information contained in a data stream,

The prototypical example of metadata is the library catalog which,
is a description of the contents of books In the early 1940s,
memory technology often permitted a capacity of a few bytes,
The first electronic programmable digital computer the ENIAC using thousands,
of octal-base radio vacuum tubes could perform simple calculations involving,
20 numbers of ten decimal digits which were held in,
the vacuum tube The next significant advance in computer memory,
came with acoustic delay line memory developed by J Presper,
Eckert in the early 1940s Through the construction of a,
glass tube filled with mercury and plugged at each end,
with a quartz crystal delay lines could store bits of,
information in the form of sound waves propagating through mercury,
with the quartz crystals acting as transducers to read and,
write bits Delay line memory was limited to a capacity,
of up to a few hundred thousand bits to remain efficient Two,
alternatives to the delay line the Williams tube and,
Selectron tube originated in 1946 both using electron beams,
in glass tubes as means of storage Using cathode,
ray tubes Fred Williams invented the Williams tube which,
was the first random-access computer memory The Williams tube,
was more capacious than the Selectron tube (the Selectron,
was limited to 256 bits while the Williams tube,
could store thousands) and less expensive The Williams tube,
was nevertheless frustratingly sensitive to environmental disturbances Efforts began,
in the late 1940s to find non-volatile memory Magnetic-core,
memory allowed for recall of memory after power loss,
It was developed by Frederick W Viehe and An,
Wang in the late 1940s and improved by Jay,
Forrester and Jan A Rajchman in the early 1950s,
before being commercialised with the Whirlwind computer in 1953,
Magnetic-core memory was the dominant form of memory until,
the development of MOS semiconductor memory in the 1960s,
Semiconductor memory began in the early 1960s with bipolar,
memory which used bipolar transistors Bipolar,
semiconductor memory made from discrete devices was first shipped by Texas Instruments,
to the United States Air Force in 1961 The same,
year the concept of solid-state memory on an integrated circuit,
(IC) chip was proposed by applications engineer Bob Norman at,
Fairchild Semiconductor The first bipolar semiconductor memory IC chip was,
the SP95 introduced by IBM in 1965 While bipolar memory,
offered improved performance over magnetic-core memory it could not compete,
with the lower price of magnetic-core which remained dominant up,
until the late 1960s Bipolar memory failed to replace magnetic-core,
memory because bipolar flip-flop circuits were too large and expensive,
MOS memory Main article: MOS memory The invention of the,
MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor or MOS transistor) by Mohamed M,
Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959 enabled,
the practical use of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) transistors as memory cell,
storage elements MOS memory was developed by John Schmidt at,
Fairchild Semiconductor in 1964 In addition to higher performance MOS,
semiconductor memory was cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic,
core memory In 1965 J Wood and R Ball of,
the Royal Radar Establishment proposed digital storage systems that use CMOS (complementary,
MOS) memory cells in addition to MOSFET power devices,
for the power supply switched cross-coupling switches and delay,
line storage The development of silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit,
(MOS IC) technology by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in,
1968 enabled the production of MOS memory chips NMOS,
memory was commercialized by IBM in the early 1970s,
MOS memory overtook magnetic core memory as the dominant,
memory technology in the early 1970s The two main,
types of volatile random-access memory (RAM) are static random-access,
memory (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) Bipolar SRAM,
was invented by Robert Norman at Fairchild Semiconductor in,
1963 followed by the development of MOS SRAM by,
John Schmidt at Fairchild in 1964 SRAM became an,
alternative to magnetic-core memory but required six MOS transistors,
for each bit of data Commercial use of SRAM,
began in 1965 when IBM introduced their SP95 SRAM,
chip for the System/360 Model 95 Toshiba introduced bipolar,
DRAM memory cells for its Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator,
in 1965 While it offered improved performance over magnetic-core,
memory bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower,
price of the then dominant magnetic-core memory MOS technology is the basis,
for modern DRAM In 1966 Dr Robert H Dennard at,
the IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center was working on,
MOS memory While examining the characteristics of MOS technology he,
found it was capable of building capacitors and that storing,
a charge or no charge on the MOS capacitor could,
represent the 1 and 0 of a bit while the,
MOS transistor could control writing the charge to the capacitor,
This led to his development of a single-transistor DRAM memory,
cell In 1967 Dennard filed a patent under IBM for,
a single-transistor DRAM memory cell based on MOS technology This,
led to the first commercial DRAM IC chip the Intel,
1103 in October 1970 Synchronous,
dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) later debuted with the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in,
1992 The term "memory" is also often used to,
refer to non-volatile memory specifically flash memory It has,
origins in read-only memory (ROM) Programmable read-only memory (PROM),
was invented by Wen Tsing Chow in 1956 while,
working for the Arma Division of the American Bosch,
Arma Corporation Data information knowledge and wisdom are closely,
related concepts but each has its own role in relation to the,
other and each term has its own meaning According,
to a common view data are collected and analyzed;,
data only becomes information suitable for making decisions once,
it has been analyzed in some fashion One can,
say that the extent to which a set of,
data is informative to someone depends on the extent,
to which it is unexpected,
by that person The amount of information contained in a data stream,
may be characterized by its Shannon entropy Knowledge is the,
understanding based on extensive experience,
dealing with information on a subject For example the height of Mount,
Everest is generally considered data The height can be measured,
precisely with an altimeter and entered into a database This,
data may be included in a book along with other,
data on Mount Everest to describe the mountain in a,
manner useful for those who wish to make a decision,
about the best method to climb it An understanding based,
on experience climbing mountains that could advise persons on the,
way to reach Mount Everest's peak may be seen as,
"knowledge" The practical climbing of Mount Everest's peak based on,
this knowledge may be seen as "wisdom" In other words,
wisdom refers to the practical application of a person's knowledge,
in those circumstances where good may result Thus wisdom complements and completes,
the series "data" "information" and "knowledge" of increasingly abstract,
concepts Data are often assumed to be the least,
abstract concept information the next least and knowledge the,
most abstract In this view data becomes information by,
interpretation; eg the height of Mount Everest is generally,
considered "data" a book on Mount Everest geological characteristics,
may be considered "information" and a climber's guidebook containing,
practical information on the best,
way to reach Mount Everest's peak may be considered "knowledge" "Information" bears,
a diversity of meanings that ranges from everyday usage,
to technical use This view however has also been,
argued to reverse the way in which data emerges,
from information and information from knowledge Generally speaking the,
concept of information is closely related to notions of,
constraint communication control data form,
instruction knowledge meaning mental stimulus,
pattern perception and representation Beynon-Davies,
uses the concept of a,
sign to differentiate between data,
and information; data are a,
series of symbols while information occurs when the symbols are used to,
refer to something Before the development of computing devices and,
machines people had to manually collect data and impose patterns,
on it Since the development of computing devices and machines,
these devices can also collect data In the 2010s computers,
are widely used in many fields to collect data and,
sort or process it in disciplines ranging from marketing analysis,
of social services usage by citizens to scientific research These,
patterns in data are seen as information which can be,
used to enhance knowledge These patterns may be interpreted as "truth" (though,
"truth" can be a subjective concept) and may be,
authorized as aesthetic and ethical criteria in some disciplines,
or cultures Events that leave behind perceivable physical or,
virtual remains can be traced back through data Marks,
are no longer considered data once the link between,
the mark and observation is broken Mechanical computing devices,
are classified according to the means by which they,
represent data An analog computer,
represents a datum as a,
voltage distance position or other,
physical quantity A digital computer,
represents a piece of data,
as a sequence of symbols drawn from a fixed alphabet The most,
common digital computers use a binary alphabet that is an,
alphabet of two characters typically denoted "0" and "1" More,
familiar representations such as numbers or letters are then constructed,
from the binary alphabet Some special forms of data are,
distinguished A computer program is a collection of data which,
can be interpreted as instructions Most computer languages make a,
distinction between programs and the other data on which programs,
operate but in some languages notably Lisp and similar languages,
programs are essentially indistinguishable from other data It is also,
useful to distinguish metadata that is a description of other,
data A similar yet earlier term for metadata is "ancillary,

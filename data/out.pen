Oracle answered the question "who,
is the wisest man in,
Greece?" by stating Socrates was,
the wisest According to Plato's,
Apology Socrates decided to investigate,
the people who might be,
considered wiser than him concluding,
they lacked true knowledge:Thus it,
became popularly immortalized in the,
phrase "I know that I,
know nothing" that it is,
wise to recognize one's own ignorance and to value,
epistemic humilityThe ancient Romans also,
valued wisdom which was personified,
in Minerva or Pallas She,
also represents skillful knowledge and,
the virtues especially chastity Her,
symbol was the owl which,
is still a popular representation,
of wisdom because it can,
see in darkness She was,
said to be born from,
Jupiter's foreheadWisdom is also important,
within Christianity Jesus emphasized it,
Paul the Apostle in his,
first epistle to the Corinthians,
argued that there is both,
secular and divine wisdom urging,
Christians to pursue the latter,
Prudence which is intimately related,
to wisdom became one of,
the four cardinal virtues of,
Catholicism The Christian philosopher Thomas,
Aquinas considered wisdom to be,
the "father" (ie the cause,
measure and form) of all,
virtuesIn Buddhist traditions developing wisdom,
plays a central role where,
comprehensive guidance on how to,
develop wisdom is provided In,
the Inuit tradition developing wisdom,
was one of the aims,
of teaching An Inuit Elder,
said that a person became,
wise when they could see,
what needed to be done,
and did it successfully without,
being told what to doIn,
many cultures the name for,
third molars which are the,
last teeth to grow is,
etymologically linked with wisdom eg,
as in the English wisdom,
tooth It has its nickname,
originated from the classical tradition which in the Hippocratic,
writings has already been called,
sophronister (in Greek related to,
the meaning of moderation or,
teaching a lesson) and in,
Latin dens sapientiae (wisdom tooth),
since they appear at the,
age of maturity in late,
adolescence and early adulthood The,
Oxford English Dictionary defines wisdom,
as "Capacity of judging rightly,
in matters relating to life,
and conduct; soundness of judgement,
in the choice of means,
and ends; sometimes less strictly,
sound sense esp in practical,
affairs: opp to folly;" also,
"Knowledge (esp of a high,
or abstruse kind); enlightenment learning,
erudition" Charles Haddon Spurgeon defined,
wisdom as "the right use,
of knowledge" Robert I Sutton,
and Andrew Hargadon defined the,
"attitude of wisdom" as "acting,
with knowledge while doubting what,
one knows" Psycanics defines wisdom,
as "the ability to foresee,
the consequences of action" (allowing,
one to avoid negative consequences,
and produce the desired positive,
ones) In social and psychological,
sciences several distinct approaches to,
wisdom exist with major advances,
made in the last two,
decades with respect to operationalization,
and measurement of wisdom as,
a psychological construct Wisdom is,
the capacity to have foreknowledge,
of something to know the,
consequences (both positive and negative),
of all the available course,
of actions and to yield,
or take the options with,
the most advantage either for,
present or future implicationThe ancient Greeks considered wisdom to,
be an important virtue personified,
as the goddesses Metis and,
Athena Metis was the first,
wife of Zeus who according,
to Hesiod's Theogony had devoured,
her pregnant; Zeus earned the,
title of Metieta ("The Wise,
Counselor") after that as Metis,
was the embodiment of wisdom,
and he gave birth to,
Athena who is said to,
have sprung from his head,
Athena was portrayed as strong,
fair merciful and chaste Apollo,
was also considered a god,
of wisdom designated as the,
conductor of the Muses (Musagetes),
who were personifications of the,
sciences and of the inspired,
and poetic arts; According to,
Plato in his Cratylus the,
name of Apollo could also,
mean "Ballon" (archer) and "Omopoulon",
(unifier of poles [divine and,
earthly]) since this god was,
responsible for divine and true,
inspirations thus considered an archer,
who was always right in,
healing and oracles: "he is,
an ever-darting archer" Apollo was,
considered the god who prophesied,
through the priestesses (Pythia) in,
the Temple of Apollo (Delphi),
where the aphorism "know thyself",
(gnothi seauton)[a] was inscribed (part,
of the wisdom of the,
Delphic maxims) He was contrasted,
with Hermes who was related,
to the sciences and technical,
wisdom and in the first,
centuries after Christ was associated,
with Thoth in an Egyptian,
syncretism under the name Hermes,
Trimegistus Greek tradition recorded the,
earliest introducers of wisdom in the Seven Sages of GreeceTo,
Socrates and Plato philosophy was literally the love of wisdom,
(philo-sophia) This permeates Plato's dialogues; in The Republic the leaders,
of his proposed utopia are philosopher kings who understand the,
Form of the Good and possess the courage to act,
accordingly Aristotle in Metaphysics defined wisdom as understanding why things,
are a certain way (causality) which is deeper than merely,
knowing things are a certain way He was the first,

(gnothi seauton)[a] was inscribed (part of the wisdom of,
the Delphic maxims) He was contrasted with Hermes who was related to,
the sciences and technical wisdom and in the first centuries,
after Christ was associated with Thoth in an Egyptian syncretism,
under the name Hermes Trimegistus Greek tradition recorded the earliest introducers of,
wisdom in the Seven Sages of GreeceTo Socrates and Plato,
philosophy was literally the love of wisdom (philo-sophia) This permeates,
Plato's dialogues; in The Republic the leaders of his proposed,
utopia are philosopher kings who understand the Form of the,
Good and possess the courage to act accordingly Aristotle in,
Metaphysics defined wisdom as understanding why things are a certain,
way (causality) which is deeper than merely knowing things are,
a certain way He was the first to make the,
distinction between phronesis and sophiaAccording to Plato and Xenophon the,
Pythia of the Delphic Oracle answered the question "who is,
the wisest man in Greece?" by stating Socrates was the,
wisest According to Plato's Apology Socrates decided to investigate the,
people who might be considered wiser than him concluding they,
lacked true knowledge:Thus it became popularly immortalized in the phrase,
"I know that I know nothing" that it is wise,
to recognize one's own ignorance and to value epistemic humilityThe,
ancient Romans also valued wisdom,
which was personified in Minerva or Pallas She also represents skillful knowledge,
and the virtues especially chastity Her symbol was the,
owl which is still a popular representation of wisdom,
because it can see in darkness She was said,
to be born from Jupiter's foreheadWisdom is also important,
within Christianity Jesus emphasized it Paul the Apostle in,
his first epistle to the Corinthians argued that there,
is both secular and divine wisdom urging Christians to,
pursue the latter Prudence which is intimately related to,
wisdom became one of the four cardinal virtues of,
Catholicism The Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas considered wisdom to,
be the "father" (ie the cause measure and form),
of all virtuesIn Buddhist traditions developing wisdom plays a,
central role where comprehensive guidance on how to develop,
wisdom is provided In the Inuit tradition developing wisdom,
was one of the aims of teaching An Inuit,
Elder said that a person became wise when they,
could see what needed to,
be done and did it successfully without being told what to doIn,
many cultures the name for third molars which are the,
last teeth to grow is etymologically linked with wisdom eg,
as in the English wisdom tooth It has its nickname,
originated from the classical tradition which in the Hippocratic writings,
has already been called sophronister (in Greek related to the,
meaning of moderation or teaching a lesson) and in Latin,
dens sapientiae (wisdom tooth) since they appear at the age,
of maturity in late adolescence and early adulthood The Oxford,
English Dictionary defines wisdom as "Capacity of judging rightly in,
matters relating to life and conduct; soundness of judgement in,
the choice of means and ends; sometimes less strictly sound,
sense esp in practical affairs: opp to folly;" also "Knowledge,
(esp of a high or abstruse kind); enlightenment learning erudition",
Charles Haddon Spurgeon defined wisdom as "the right use of,
knowledge" Robert I Sutton and Andrew Hargadon defined the "attitude,
of wisdom" as "acting with knowledge while doubting what one,
knows" Psycanics defines wisdom as "the,
ability to foresee the consequences of action" (allowing one to avoid negative,
consequences and produce the desired positive ones) In social,
and psychological sciences several distinct approaches to wisdom exist,
with major advances made in the last two decades,
with respect to operationalization and measurement of wisdom as,
a psychological construct Wisdom is the capacity to have,
foreknowledge of something to know the consequences (both positive,
and negative) of all the available course of actions,
and to yield or take the options with the,
most advantage either for present or future implicationThe ancient,
Greeks considered wisdom to be an important virtue personified,
as the goddesses Metis and Athena Metis was the,
first wife of Zeus who,
according to Hesiod's Theogony had devoured her pregnant; Zeus earned the title,
of Metieta ("The Wise Counselor") after that as Metis,
was the embodiment of wisdom and he gave birth,
to Athena who is said to have sprung from,
his head Athena was portrayed as strong fair merciful,
and chaste Apollo was also considered a god of,
wisdom designated as the conductor of the Muses (Musagetes),
who were personifications of the sciences and of the,
inspired and poetic arts; According to Plato in his,
Cratylus the name of Apollo,
could also mean "Ballon" (archer),
and "Omopoulon" (unifier of poles,
[divine and earthly]) since this,
god was responsible for divine and true inspirations thus considered an archer,
who was always right in healing and oracles: "he is,
an ever-darting archer" Apollo was,
considered the god who prophesied through the priestesses (Pythia) in the Temple,
of Apollo (Delphi) where the aphorism "know thyself" (gnothi seauton)[a],

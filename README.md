**WiSDOM : WriterScript based Data Obfuscation Module**

WiSDOM is a strategic Data Obfuscation Module that takes your sensitive data and converts it into a work of literature.
This means that even if your data is intercepted the original content will be secure and the attacker will see something else altogether. You can disguise your Bank Account details as a chapter from Harry Potter and no one would be the wiser.
Even if your sensitive data is intercepted chances are that it will be ignored due to its innocuous appearance. With the increasing use of cyberspace, everything is online and thus accessible to attackers. From Private messages to Financial Details everything can be intercepted online.

WiSDOM can obfuscate your plaintext/data structure/ binary data (<1MB) into **infinite** combinations of random data for transmission over insecure internet protocols like HTTP, TELNET, and FTP. This **can also be extended to store data in databases** where heavy encryption algorithms cannot be implemented due to resource constraints or instant messaging services. More accessible than many encryptions algorithms, efficient on low-end systems.

WiSDOM also provides and easy-to-use API and GUI (made in Python3 Flask).
